# Important OSX Applications

## [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
 * Syncs your files across pretty much any device.

## [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
 * Awesome text editor / note-keeper
 * Create a folder structure with notes
 * File->Open the root folder with Sublime for a nice navigation panel on the left
 * Combine this with Dropbox and your notes will sync anywhere

## [One Note](https://www.onenote.com/)
 * Probably duplicates Sublime Text
 * Great for pictures/guides
 * Also has clients for just about every OS, and syncs

## [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/downloads)
 * Self-driven password manager
 * Keep your database in Dropbox
 * Clients for pretty much every operating system

## [iTerm 2, version 3](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html)
 * May not seem exciting at first
 * Will enable you to use Automator to script workflows

## [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
 * ESSENTIAL to cleanly install and uninstall new command line tools and services.

## [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
 * Is awesome
 * Keystroke pops up a search box that can find/do almost anything
 * launch an app, run script, lock your computer, change settings, etc.
 * It learns which action you usually take as well, reordering the list of results as you type

## [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx)
 * Pretty solid FTP (and SFTP) client
 * Might want to look into [FileZilla Secure](http://www.filezillasecure.com/)

## [ZShell](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
 * Very nice shell replacement
 * "brew install zsh" to install it
 * After that, install [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
 * In ~/.zshrc, configure it to use this profile: ZSH_THEME="pygmalion"
 * That has lots of nice features, customize it or pick a different one later

## [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
 * You will eventually need XCode's command line tools, just go ahead and install it

## [Android File transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/)
 * Make moving files to/from phones super easy

## [Disk Inventory X](http://www.derlien.com/downloads/index.html)
 * Visualize what's taking up so much space on your hard drive

## [Appcleaner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/app-cleaner-find-remove-applications/id1013897218?mt=12)
